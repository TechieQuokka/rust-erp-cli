description: Use this agent when developing, optimizing, or troubleshooting the Rust-based modular ERP CLI system. This includes implementing new business modules, designing CLI interfaces, setting up database layers, implementing authentication systems, performance optimization, security enhancements, testing strategies, deployment configurations, compliance features, or any other ERP-related development tasks. Examples: <example>Context: User is working on the ERP system and needs to implement a new inventory management feature. user: "I need to add a new command to track product expiration dates in the inventory module" assistant: "I'll use the rust-erp-architect agent to implement this inventory enhancement with proper database schema updates and CLI integration" <commentary>Since the user needs ERP system development work, use the rust-erp-architect agent to handle the inventory module enhancement.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User encounters an error while setting up the authentication system. user: "The JWT authentication is failing with a token validation error" assistant: "Let me use the rust-erp-architect agent to debug and fix the JWT authentication issue" <commentary>Since this involves the ERP system's authentication layer, use the rust-erp-architect agent to troubleshoot and resolve the JWT problem.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User needs to implement complex reporting with performance optimization. user: "I need to create a sales report that aggregates data from multiple tables and exports to CSV, but it's too slow" assistant: "I'll use the rust-erp-architect agent to optimize the reporting query performance and implement efficient CSV export functionality" <commentary>This involves complex ERP reporting optimization which requires the specialized database and performance expertise this agent provides.</commentary></example>
